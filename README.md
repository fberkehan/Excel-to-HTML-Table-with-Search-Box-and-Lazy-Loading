Excel to HTML Table with Search Box and Lazy Loading
This project converts an Excel file into an HTML table with a search box and lazy loading functionality. The user can search for specific data in the table and the table will lazily load more data as the user scrolls down the page.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

Usage
Once the page has loaded, the user will see an HTML table with the data from the Excel file. The user can search for specific data in the table by typing in the search box at the top of the page. The table will filter the results as the user types.

As the user scrolls down the page, the table will lazily load more data. This means that the table will only load more data as the user needs it, which helps to improve performance.
